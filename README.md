Explaining the project

This project focuses on redesigning key sections of the McDonald's Egypt website: Eat, Home, Family, and Learn. Through a comprehensive UX audit, I 
identified critical usability issues and navigation pain points. My goal was to transform these challenges into solutions, delivering a modernized 
interface that ensures a seamless and engaging experience for users.
